# INT______________________________________________
age : int = 30
money : int = 100
test :int = -45

#can use math operators with ints 
print(age + money)
print(age / money)
print(age - money)

#int can be converted to float 
 
# FLOAT______________________________________________
percent: float = 0.5
height: float = 1.72
width: float = 23.2333

#can use math operators with Float 
print(percent + height)
print(width / percent)
#float cannot be easily converted to int ( 10.2 -> int would yield an error without rounding the number up)

#OPERATORS__________________________________________________________
# // # Floor devision - this prints a divided by b but cuts it by the decimal and only gives us the whole number
# ** # Exponetional
# %  # Modulous - returns the remainder  (works opposite of floor devision)
# -
# +
# /


a:int = 10
b: int = 12
#we use floor devision opoerator
c = a // b

#ASSIGMENT OPERATORS

x -=2  # this is the same as x= x - 2
x /=2  # this is the same as x= x / 2

# COMPARISON OPRATORS (returns boolean true or false)
# == Equality operator 
# != exclimation meants not , so not equal to 
# >
# <
a:int = 10

#defining a function that captures user's expression,
# does a calculation based on the operator the user choose and then returns the answer

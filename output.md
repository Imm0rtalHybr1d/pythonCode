Imagine you're holding a big, heavy toy in front of you, like a giant teddy bear!  You're going to pretend to sit down on a tiny chair, but you're not actually sitting down.  

You're going to bend your knees and lower your body down, like you're about to sit on the chair, but then you're going to stand back up!  That's a goblet squat!  

You can do this with your teddy bear toy, or you can even use a big, heavy book.  It's like playing a game! 

Remember to keep your back straight and your knees in line with your toes.  You can do it slow and steady, like a turtle, or fast and bouncy, like a bunny!
